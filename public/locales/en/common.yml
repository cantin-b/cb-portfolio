  title: "what i do"
  description: >
    I help small and mid-sized businesses build tools that make their day easier: a website that brings in requests, or a custom web app that fits how you actually work.
    From a simple <b>brochure website</b> to <b>tailor-made software</b>, I design, build and deploy solutions with <b>React/Next.js</b> and <b>Node.js</b>.
    Typical projects include quote/request forms, booking flows, dashboards, <b>CRM / back-office</b> tools, and integrations that keep your workflow smooth and predictable.
