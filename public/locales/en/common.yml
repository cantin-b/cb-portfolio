  description: >
    Over the past {{professionalYears}}, I’ve been building and maintaining web applications 
    as a <b>Full-Stack Developer</b>, solving real-world problems using clean code and modern 
    tools. I work across the stack, from modernizing legacy codebases and implementing
    <b>frontend</b> integration, to integrating <b>APIs</b> and building <b>backend</b> features.
    I also help clients ship <b>SaaS</b> products and custom <b>CRM / back-office</b> tools, and integrate <b>AI</b> features (LLMs, automation, RAG) when it makes sense.
